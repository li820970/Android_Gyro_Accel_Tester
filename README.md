# Android_Gyro_Accel_Tester
project for student space systems to read phone acceleromter/gyroscope for testing

This is mostlyh a learning experience

TODO
-logging
-change package name to something that's not this repo (I though the website field would just add a @tag or something :( )
-add support for other sensors
-maybe get a proper naming convention
-use sharedprefs proper instead of static privates
-graphics to show current orientaion/vector 
-attitude indicator
-unregister/register broadcastreceiver properly so the app isn't one massive memory leak
